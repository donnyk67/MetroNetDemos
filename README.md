# MetroNetDemos
5 projects in the solutios and a brief demo video.
Please play the mp4 file called "DemoVideo" in the CommonLibrary project.
Set whatever project you want to test as the start project, but note that the API project should be ran in Swagger.
To do this just type in "/swagger/ui/index" after the localhost url.

***Note***: The Draw Five Card Game is not shown in the video demo. 
Please play the Draw Five Card Game in the WPF project. There is also a web version of it in the Web (mvc) project.
